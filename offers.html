                We are often asked what makes a brilliant text message. There is no right answer to this as there is no
                such thing as a size that fits all, but there are SMS templates that have proven to be effective for
                businesses. All of them share the following elements: powerful call-to-action triggers; the sender’s ID,
                name and phone number; and, occasionally, a short link to the sender’s website.

                In a recent post, Neil Patel mentioned that simply slapping a few common call-to-action triggers in an
                email or SMS won’t cut it, because the perfect call to action has to resonate with the audience and
                create a sense of urgency (example: words like ‘today’ and ‘now’). With these things in mind, we have
                created a list of ready-to-use text message templates for small businesses.

                Marketing and Promotional SMS Templates.
                Appointment Reminders.
                SMS Notifications and Alerts.
                SMS Confirmations.
                Payment Reminders.
                Banking Templates.
                SMS Polls.
                SMS Contest Templates.
                Staff Communication.
                Marketing and Promotional SMS Templates
                The marketing and promotional SMS templates listed below work because they are attention grabbers, they
                use powerful calls to action, they create a sense of urgency, and they share information in a clear and
                concise manner. Feel free to experiment with the wording of your messages, monitor their performance and
                tweak them based on your audience’s response.

            The marketing and promotional text messages work because they share information in a clear and concise
            manner

            Appointment Reminders
            Three out of ten people can’t tell you what day of the week it is, let alone remember any of their
            appointments, so you have to give them a friendly nudge. Appointment reminders are professional and
            effective because they leverage the instantaneous nature of text messaging. These type of text messages
            should contain the exact date and time of the appointment, the location, your name (or your company’s
            name) and your phone number.

            Customer feedback: “We are finding that fewer patients forget or miss their appointments after receiving
            a text reminder. The pre-scheduling system works really well for us!”
